      <description>This is a simple post showing a basic configuration for setting up OpenVPN server accepting multiple clients with TLS.&#xA;First of all generate self-signed server and client private key and certificates, and dh params. Make sure to write the Organization Name AND Common Name (CN) when asked, otherwise openvpn will fail to verify the certificates.&#xA;openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout serverkey.pem -x509 -days 365000 -out servercert.pem openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout clientkey.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Docker and Nix today. Before explaining what Nix is, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know yet, and before going into the details, I will show you a snippet similar to a Dockerfile for creating a Redis image equivalent to the one in docker hub.&#xA;The final image will be around 42mb (or 25mb) in size, compared to 177mb.&#xA;EDIT: as mentioned on HN, alpine-based images can even go around 15mb in size.</description>

      <description>TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, the way you expect it to be.&#xA;I’ve heard of it a long time ago, but recently with TypeScript 1.7 it got async functions, which means you can awaitasynchronous function calls, similarly to C#, Vala, Go and other languages with syntax support for concurrency. That makes coroutines a pleasant experience compared to plain JavaScript. That’s also the main reason why I didn’t choose Dart.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 19th Nix pill. In the previous 18th pill we did dive into the algorithm used by Nix to compute the store paths, and also introduced fixed-output store paths.&#xA;This time we will instead look into nixpkgs, in particular one of its core derivation: stdenv .&#xA;The stdenv is not a special derivation, but it&amp;rsquo;s very important for the nixpkgs repository. It serves as base for packaging software. It is used to pull in dependencies such as the GCC toolchain, GNU make, core utilities, patch and diff utilities, and so on.</description>

      <description>This is a follow up post on https://medium.com/@dan.ellis/you-dont-need-1mm-for-a-distributed-system-70901d4741e1 . I think the post was well written, so I decided to write a variant using NixOS.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ll be using declarative nixos containers, which do not use docker but systemd-nspawn. Also systemd is started as init system inside containers.&#xA;Please note that this configuration can be applied to any nixos machine, and also the containers configuration could be applied to real servers or other kinds of virtualization, e.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Go since several months. It&amp;rsquo;s a pleasant language, even though it has its own drawbacks.&#xA;In our Nixpkgs repository we have support for several programming languages: perl, python, ruby, haskell, lua, &amp;hellip; We&amp;rsquo;ve merged a better support for Go.&#xA;What kind of support are we talking about? In Nix, you never install libraries. Instead, you define an environment in which to use a certain library compiled for a certain version of the language.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 18th Nix pill. In the previous 17th pill we have scratched the surface of the nixpkgs repository structure. It is a set of packages, and it&amp;rsquo;s possible to override such packages so that all other packages will use the overrides.&#xA;Before reading existing derivations, I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about store paths and how they are computed. In particular we are interested in fixed store paths that depend on an integrity hash (e.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 17th Nix pill. In the previous 16th pill we have started to dive into the nixpkgs repository. Nixpkgs is a function, and we&amp;rsquo;ve looked at some parameters like system and config.&#xA;Today we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about a special attribute: config.packageOverrides. Overriding packages in a set with fixed point can be considered another design pattern in nixpkgs.&#xA;Overriding a package I recall the override design pattern from the nix pill 14.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 16th Nix pill. In the previous 15th pill we&amp;rsquo;ve realized how nix finds expressions with the angular brackets syntax, so that we finally know where is located on our system.&#xA;We can start diving into the nixpkgs repository, through all the various tools and design patterns. Please note that also nixpkgs has its own manual, underlying the difference between the general &amp;ldquo;nix&amp;rdquo; language and the &amp;ldquo;nixpkgs&amp;rdquo; repository.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 15th Nix pill. In the previous 14th pill we have introduced the &amp;ldquo;override&amp;rdquo; pattern, useful for writing variants of derivations by passing different inputs.&#xA;Assuming you followed the previous posts, I hope you are now ready to understand nixpkgs. But we have to find nixpkgs in our system first! So this is the step: introducing some options and environment variables used by nix tools.&#xA;The NIX_PATH The NIX_PATH environment variable is very important.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 14th Nix pill. In the previous 13th pill we have introduced the callPackage pattern, used to simplify the composition of software in a repository.&#xA;The next design pattern is less necessary but useful in many cases and it&amp;rsquo;s a good exercise to learn more about Nix.&#xA;About composability Functional languages are known for being able to compose functions. In particular, you gain a lot from functions that are able to manipulate the original value into a new value having the same structure.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 13th Nix pill. In the previous 12th pill we have introduced the first basic design pattern for organizing a repository of software. In addition we packaged graphviz to have at least another package for our little repository.&#xA;The next design pattern worth noting is what I&amp;rsquo;d like to call the callPackage pattern. This technique is extensively used in nixpkgs, it&amp;rsquo;s the current standard for importing packages in a repository.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 12th Nix pill. In the previous 11th pill we stopped packaging and cleaned up the system with the garbage collector.&#xA;We restart our packaging, but we will improve a different aspect. We only packaged an hello world program so far, what if we want to create a repository of multiple packages?&#xA;Repositories in Nix Nix is a tool for build and deployment, it does not enforce any particular repository format.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 11th Nix pill. In the previous 10th pill we managed to obtain a self-contained environment for developing a project. The concept is that whereas nix-build is able to build a derivation in isolation, nix-shell is able to drop us in a shell with (almost) the same environment used by nix-build. This allows us to debug, modify and manually build software.&#xA;Today we stop packaging and look at a mandatory nix component, the garbage collector.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 10th Nix pill. In the previous 9th pill we have seen one of the powerful features of nix, automatic discovery of runtime dependencies and finalized the GNU hello world package.&#xA;In return from vacation, we want to hack a little the GNU hello world program. The nix-build tool creates an isolated environment for building the derivation, we want to do the same in order to modify some source files of the project.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 9th Nix pill. In the previous 8th pill we wrote a generic builder for autotools projects. We feed build dependencies, a source tarball, and we get a Nix derivation as a result.&#xA;Today we stop by the GNU hello world program to analyze build and runtime dependencies, and enhance the builder in order to avoid unnecessary runtime dependencies.&#xA;Build dependencies Let&amp;rsquo;s start analyzing build dependencies for our GNU hello world package:</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 8th Nix pill. In the previous 7th pill we successfully built a derivation. We wrote a builder script that compiled a C file and installed the binary under the nix store.&#xA;In this post, we will generalize the builder script, write a Nix expression for GNU hello world and create a wrapper around the derivation built-in function.&#xA;Packaging GNU hello world In the previous pill we packaged a simple .</description>

      <description>Welcome to the seventh Nix pill. In the previous sixth pill we introduced the notion of derivation in the Nix language. How to define a raw derivation and how to (try) to build it.&#xA;In this post, we will continue along the path, by creating a derivation that successfully builds something.&#xA;Then we try to package a real program: we compile a simple C file and create a derivation out of it, given a blessed toolchain.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the sixth Nix pill. In the previous fifth pill we introduced functions and imports. Functions and imports are very simple concepts that allows for building complex abstractions and composition of modules to build a flexible Nix system.&#xA;In this post we finally arrived to writing a derivation. Derivations are the building blocks of a Nix system, from a file system view point. The Nix language is used to describe such derivations.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the fifth Nix pill. In the previous fourth pill we touched the Nix language for a moment. We introduced basic types and values of the Nix language, and basic expressions such as &amp;ldquo;if&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;with&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rdquo;. I invite you to re-read about these expressions and play with them in the repl.&#xA;Functions help to build reusable components in a big repository like nixpkgs. The Nix manual has a great explanation of functions.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the fourth Nix pill. In the previous third pill we entered the Nix environment. We installed software as user, managed the profile, switched between generations, and queried the nix store. That&amp;rsquo;s the very basics of nix administration somehow.&#xA;The Nix language is used to write derivations. The nix-build tool is used to build derivations. Even as a system administrator that wants to customize the installation, it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to master Nix.</description>

Now we can finally play with it a little, things also apply to NixOS users.&#xA;Enter the environment In the previous pill we created a nix user, so let&amp;rsquo;s start by switching user with su - nix. If your ~/.profile got evaluated, then you should now be able to run commands like nix-env and nix-store.</description>

      <description>Introduction&#xA;Welcome to the first post of the Nix in pills series. Nix is a purely functional package manager and deployment system for POSIX. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of documentation that describes what Nix, NixOS and related projects are.&#xA;The purpose of this post is to convince you to give Nix a try. Installing NixOS is not required, but sometimes I may refer to NixOS as a real world example of Nix usage for building a whole operating system.</description>

      <description>Without wmctrl I&amp;rsquo;m lost. I use it together with xbindkeys so that pressing a combination of keys will raise a window of the desktop (editor, shell, browser, chat, &amp;hellip;).&#xA;It turns out however that in NixOS wmctrl didn&amp;rsquo;t work well. I had 3 windows opened, and wmctrl -l only showed one. Since gnome3 is still young in nixos, the first thought was that mutter did something wrong when returning the list of clients, due to some possible packaging mistake.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;re aware of vc-git-grep command in Emacs, but it has a downside: you must specify the file extension every time, and it&amp;rsquo;s case-sensitive.&#xA;I propose you an alternative vc-git-grep2 that is case-insensitive and only requires the directory in which to start the search.&#xA;(defun vc-git-grep2 (regexp dir) (interactive (progn (grep-compute-defaults) (cond ((equal current-prefix-arg &amp;#39;(16)) (list (read-from-minibuffer &amp;#34;Run: &amp;#34; &amp;#34;git grep&amp;#34; nil nil &amp;#39;grep-history) nil)) (t (let\* ((regexp (grep-read-regexp)) (dir (read-directory-name &amp;#34;In directory: &amp;#34; nil default-directory t))) (list regexp dir)))))) (require &amp;#39;grep) (when (and (stringp regexp) (\&amp;gt; (length regexp) 0)) (let ((command regexp)) (if (\&amp;gt; 4 5) (if (string\= command &amp;#34;git grep&amp;#34;) (setq command nil)) (setq dir (file-name-as-directory (expand-file-name dir))) (setq command (grep-expand-template &amp;#34;git grep -n -i -e &amp;lt;R&amp;gt;&amp;#34; regexp)) (when command (if (equal current-prefix-arg &amp;#39;(4)) (setq command (read-from-minibuffer &amp;#34;Confirm: &amp;#34; command nil nil &amp;#39;grep-history)) (add-to-history &amp;#39;grep-history command)))) (when command (let ((default-directory dir) (compilation-environment &amp;#39;(&amp;#34;PAGER=&amp;#34;))) ;; Setting process-setup-function makes exit-message-function work ;; even when async processes aren&amp;#39;t supported.</description>

      <description>One side of the idea:&#xA;Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some comment systems that inline comments in the text itself, see an example here.&#xA;Other side of the idea:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented a couple of unsupervised algorithms for news text extraction from web pages in Javascript, and they work generally well. They&amp;rsquo;re also capable of splitting the news text into paragraphs and avoid image captions or other unrelated text.&#xA;The idea:&#xA;Merge the two ideas, as a new commenting service (like Disqus) for blogs, in a modern and interesting way.</description>

      <guid>https://lucabrun.github.io/2013/06/accessing-simple-private-fields-in-php.html</guid>
      <description>A way of accessing private fields in PHP is by changing the accessibility of the fields themselves with http://php.net/manual/en/reflectionproperty.setaccessible.php.&#xA;However this approach requires PHP 5.3.&#xA;For PHP &amp;lt; 5.3 there&amp;rsquo;s another subtle way of accessing private properties:&#xA;function getPrivateProperty($fixture, $propname) {&#xA;try {&#xA;$arr = (array)$fixture;&#xA;} catch (Exception $e) {&#xA;}&#xA;$class = get_class($fixture);&#xA;$privname = &amp;ldquo;\0$class\0$propname&amp;rdquo;;&#xA;return $arr[$privname];&#xA;}&#xA;Usage is pretty straightforward, pass in the object and the property name as string.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to introduce you a very nice alternative to make: the Shake build system, by setting up a builder for your Vala application project.&#xA;First of all, you need to know that Shake is a library written in Haskell, and it&amp;rsquo;s meant to be a better replacement for make. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by installing cabal and then shake:&#xA;apt-get install cabal-install cabal update cabal install shake TL;DR; this is the final Build.</description>

      <description>Today I want to share a very simple script that works with most Linux window managers: switch window by name.&#xA;It works like this: you press Ctrl+Alt+M, then a dialog appears where you write part of the name of the window, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get switched to the window that matches the provided name.The string your provide will match part of window names in case-insensitive mode.&#xA;That means if you have &amp;ldquo;Foo - Mozilla Firefox&amp;rdquo; and type in &amp;ldquo;fire&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;ll switch to firefox.</description>

      <description>Many times I had to give focus to a newly created Gtk widget that still had to be mapped to screen. Since widget.grab_focus() does not work if the widget is not displayed on the screen, then I always used an idle source to delay the operation.&#xA;Today I noticed that the idle may be too late: if the user is writing something, then some key strokes may be lost because the idle runs slightly after the widget has been mapped.</description>

Unfortunately I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any algorithm for such a basic problem.&#xA;Therefore, I decided to write the following naive algorithm which is fast enough for my purposes (O(n2) in time and space, where n is the number of events), and share with everyone:</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve written a simple Python script using the Bluez (version 4.66) stack (thanks to http://shr-project.org/trac/wiki/Using) with this usage:&#xA;python connect.py MACADDRESS PIN MOUNTPOINT&#xA;Snippet code for connect.py is here. If the device is paired, it will be removed and unmounted.&#xA;Disconnection is as easy with:&#xA;python disconnect.py MACADDRESS MOUNTPOINT&#xA;Snippet code for disconnect.py is here.&#xA;Feel free to use the code also for other services, in this case my primary concern was to mount the file system.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;lately I&amp;rsquo;m writing GMua for educational purposes and for evaluating Vala, whose purpose is to simplify writing Mail User Agents or simple scripts, ala Java Mail.&#xA;It currently parses IMAP (not yet complete) and has a graphical interface called Gutt (yes, inspired by Mutt) for testing.&#xA;In order to parse MIME parts with base64 or quopri content-transfer-encoding I chose to implement a couple of GConverter (will use GMime a day, maybe when they switch to gio, not yet needed) in Vala that you can find here:</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve just released the first version of Maja, the Vala to Javascript compiler. The mapping is not quite complete but you can do pretty much everything you could do with javascript directly. There are (still incomplete) bindings for the qooxdoo framework and the demo browser is being ported to vala successfully.&#xA;Maja can be used in any environments, not only web browsers.&#xA;Programming in Vala saves you from lots of type safety troubles (Javascript), lot of typing (Java) and the syntax is really enjoyable as it is quite close to the Javascript model.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been pointed out to this by a post here on why both Google and Yahoo suck (and why Google search does more).&#xA;In older posts of mine you can find some examples on how Google search can miserably fail a search.&#xA;The main problem with the two approaches is: Google (and Bing too) sorts by popularity, Yahoo by match.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;recently Mash has been released. It is a library for reading models in PLY format and creating Clutter actors from them. For reference, Blender is able to export to PLY. It means you can draw your models with Blender and use Clutter as rendering engine.&#xA;Clutter is a 3D canvas and animation toolkit while Blender is a 3D modelling suite.&#xA;What I&amp;rsquo;ve tested so far is porting the Monkey Viewer C example to Vala: code snippet and monkey PLY here.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve written a MIPS32 (Release 2) disassembler for ELF files. It is not a simple disassembler, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly made for reverse engineering proprietary boxes for educational purposes. It has been successfully tested on Vodafone Station which has Broadcom binaries. These boxes don&amp;rsquo;t have a sections table, therefore normal disassemblers don&amp;rsquo;t work. Mipsdis instead will guess the bounds of those sections (most important ones are TEXT and RODATA for strings).</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d like to point you to this firefox extension HTTPS Everywhere (June 17th, 2010) and SSLGuard which is also a firefox extension (first released Oct 14th, 2009).&#xA;The code of the former extension is a lot more complicated and the result is not always quite the same as SSLGuard. In fact, while they support secure cookies and per-website custom rules, SSLGuard lets you add custom websites to be secured directly from a friendly graphical dialog.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;Google Reader has just wiped out my subscriptions list, which made me scream like a crazy monkey (other than cleaning up the list).Now I&amp;rsquo;m using bloglines, which looks pretty good except there&amp;rsquo;s nothing like &amp;ldquo;read all items&amp;rdquo;, but you must clean on each feed to see the items (any alternative to bloglines supporting this?).&#xA;But as far as I can see, I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one that lost the feeds, the difference is that I just opened the reader without any other operation.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;yes&amp;hellip; this is the nth program I&amp;rsquo;m writing in this period. I hope this is the last one :)&#xA;Valagtkdoc is a tool that integrates Vala with GTK-Doc for documentation generation.&#xA;You can find download and example usage at the homepage.&#xA;I think it&amp;rsquo;s far from being perfect, and actually I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried integrating it with autotools, but it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that hard. Unfortunately, you have to somehow break the gtk-doc rule &amp;ldquo;do not run it manually&amp;rdquo; because valagtkdoc goes in the middle between gtkdoc-scan and gtkdoc-mkdb.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;lately I&amp;rsquo;ve received some feedback, thanks for this.&#xA;Is it compatible with apt? Can I use dpkg back again after using tdpkg?&#xA;The answer is&amp;hellip; yes! You can use what you want in the order you want, and use tdpkg when you want. Take in consideration that after using dpkg (or apt) without tdpkg, then you use tdpkg the cache will be rebuilt for consistency.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s not working here (Ubuntu, other distro&amp;hellip;), doesn&amp;rsquo;t create the cache.</description>

      <guid>https://lucabrun.github.io/2010/03/tdpkg-speed-up-reading-dpkg-database.html</guid>
      <description>Hello,&#xA;you may have noticed that dpkg takes a long time reading the database the first time you run it (e.g. through apt). This is because of the huge number of /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list files (1700+ on my desktop machines). It can take up to 14 seconds and more at cold start to install/remove a single package.&#xA;Since 2007 in dpkg mailing list a first proposal (by Sean Finney) to using sqlite as cache has been posted, then a couple of weeks ago I reproposed it.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s often useful for Vala hackers to have a graphical representation of the code tree and control flow blocks. Therefore I&amp;rsquo;ve created a simple application called Valag which generates four types of diagrams using Graphviz for each state of the Vala compiler.&#xA;This is the first release, there&amp;rsquo;re many things to fix and enhance (like command line options) but it is working quite good already to give support when hacking Vala.</description>

With yahoo search it&amp;rsquo;s at the first position (lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg).&#xA;Like for the previous posts, using different search engines matters and matches your needs.</description>

Now I&amp;rsquo;m rewriting it in Vala, both for providing a good and really simple API in C and for learning Vala.&#xA;I will now paste a snippet from the new freespeak code that I use for creating a cancellable asyncronous operation for fetching a web page using libsoup either with a GET or a POST method.</description>

Read the question as it is, don&amp;rsquo;t read &amp;ldquo;what Python does that Lua can&amp;rsquo;t do&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s different.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;due to some synchronization problems between my desktop and laptop, unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my GPG secret key. I was planning to renew my key after the SHA issues, but this way I can&amp;rsquo;t neither revoke the old key nor sign the new key. So I please anybody having my pubkey to delete it:&#xA;gpg &amp;ndash;delete-key C29A9371&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded my new key as usual so you can get it:&#xA;gpg &amp;ndash;keyserver pgp.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;together a couple of university mates we talked about a possible free (as in freedom) ArchiCAD alternative. There are several free CAD out there but none is free for architects/engineers. The project is too big and ambitious, but I wanted to give OpenGL a shot with this excuse to learn something new.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve started two projects:&#xA;Corraza, the OpenGL framework for editing 3d objects and exporting the scene graph to ray tracing software&amp;hellip; think about a very very very minimal blender but as library</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;a while ago I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about pango cairo and how to generate pdf with a couple of tables.&#xA;In the meantime I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on it, improving and enhancing new kinds of elements. This has lead to the creation of a small project, a library providing a simple framework for generating mostly PDF reports (I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried to generate SVG or something else yet).&#xA;After a couple of release requests, I&amp;rsquo;ve found finally the time to publish a sort of working code.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;lately I was wondering if there was any alternative to the well known reportlab python software for creating PDF reports. I immediately thought about Cairo. The only two problems are:&#xA;Cairo doesn&amp;rsquo;t create multiple pages No support for creating tables containing text, necessary for table-based reports I still can&amp;rsquo;t realize how to achieve the first feature, but the second one could be solved using Pango layouts.&#xA;The idea is to create the cells of the table using such layouts, so that the text get wrapped etc.</description>

Well that was only a mirage as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really grab the key but it&amp;rsquo;s only a visual entry in the keyboard shortcuts preferences.</description>

      <description>Vagalume, GTK+ and Last.fm&#xA;Originally uploaded by Lethalman&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve found this great gstreamer application to listen to the last.fm stations. It works perfectly, fully functional and up-to-date. Features several IM status updates, including telepathy. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely good-looking with my dark theme.&#xA;Homepage: http://vagalume.igalia.com/&#xA;Last.fm group: http://www.last.fm/group/Vagalume</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s being developed by SuSE. It feels nice, robust and innovative.&#xA;The screenshot is showing the documents tab.&#xA;To install, aptitude install gnome-main-menu and add the new applet.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using qemu a lot lately because I&amp;rsquo;m creating an usb hdd with debian live.&#xA;The image contains a system running postgresql, development packages for gtk and python and gnome-core . All this ends up loading in more than 5 minutes, this is really boring.&#xA;Then I begun looking for a faster virtualization system, and found KVM. Unfortunately my processor hasn&amp;rsquo;t the right flag for it.&#xA;Finally I found kqemu, which is a module for the kernel that speeds up a lot qemu.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m using debian lenny and I&amp;rsquo;ve got these two problems:&#xA;With versions of the linux kernel prior to 2.6.20 (maybe) I could install zd1211 firmware using the module-assistant which has been now dropped from testing and unstable. Boot process slowed down by 30 seconds and couldn&amp;rsquo;t plug-in the usb pen because udev/hal screw up What I&amp;rsquo;ve done is to remove the source and its created firmware, with the one shipped with testing and unstable (bug #411912):</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;this is my second post about Debian. I&amp;rsquo;m lately discovering all the tools for both managing my Debian system and creating packages.&#xA;dh_make is the first tool I&amp;rsquo;ve used for the &amp;ldquo;first debianization&amp;rdquo; (called so by the New maintainers&amp;rsquo; guide) which creates a basic template for your package.&#xA;Anyway after a few packagings I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that something redundant could be automatized further.&#xA;What I suggest is a tool that does the following stuff after dh_make has been called:</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;after several months a new version of Syx has been released. This release contains mostly VM changes and some changes to the Smalltalk Collections. As usual, release notes follow:&#xA;This versions enhances a new version of the interpreter, major updates to the scheduler, and as usual a lot of bug fixes. Syx left the Google Code SVN repositories because of many connection problems.&#xA;You can find informations about the new GIT repository here: http://code.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;you all know that Gtk+ has locks for the GUI when dealing with the X server and prevent async events to be sent. This is done by manually acquiring/releasing the lock on Gdk. Many Gtk+ ports don&amp;rsquo;t do this automatically.&#xA;Syx used gtk_main() into a thread and automatically put gdk enter/leave for each function in its wrapper. It would be somewhat ugly in Smalltalk code having to enter/leave each time.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I switched to Debian lately and i think it will become my preferred distribution.&#xA;I started with Slackware, then an LFS and then Gentoo. I never found them definitive for me.&#xA;I used Slackware by compiling sources most of all, then i didn&amp;rsquo;t see any reason to continue using it.&#xA;The LFS came since my new PC as a test, and as long I could maintain it I had no problems and had fun with it.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;Smalltalk YX is currently working on refactoring a part of the interpreter, relative to contexts and stack management.&#xA;The current version uses one stack per process but always create contexts for each method or block entered.&#xA;The new branch, called newinterp, won&amp;rsquo;t create those contexts anymore but they will be created only on-demand (e.g. thisContext). This means both less resources and garbage collector usage, and a possible speedup.&#xA;More informations on the mailing list here.</description>

This happens with many more searches.&#xA;In my opinion, Google lately is lacking a good page weight system and therefore it breaks results showing for example mailing lists instead of more important web pages.&#xA;Conclusion?
