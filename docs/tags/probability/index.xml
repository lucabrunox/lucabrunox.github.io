      <description>Lately I was looking for a copy &amp;rsquo;n paste algorithm to calculate the probability of a union of independent events that are not mutually exclusive (aka inclusion-exclusion principle in probability). Unfortunately I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any algorithm for such a basic problem.&#xA;Therefore, I decided to write the following naive algorithm which is fast enough for my purposes (O(n2) in time and space, where n is the number of events), and share with everyone:</description>
