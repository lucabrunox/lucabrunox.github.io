      <description>Hello,&#xA;after some work in these weeks now I have released a new version of FreeSpeak.&#xA;FreeSpeak is a free (as in freedom, developed and released under the terms of GPL) frontend to online translator engines (such as Google, Yahoo, etc.). It is written in Python, it uses the GTK toolkit and some GNOME infrastructure features&#xA;.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s been rewritten almost from scratch so I think there&amp;rsquo;s no need to post release notes here.</description>
