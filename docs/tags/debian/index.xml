      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m bumping a breaking news from debian.net: Introducing codesearch.debian.net, a regexp code search engine&#xA;The days of google codesearch are ended since a while, but now we have an up-to-date and open source debian codesearch.&#xA;(from the about page):&#xA;It searches all the open source projects which are included in the Debian archive (the &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; distribution only, not non-free or contrib). Currently, that includes about 18000 packages with 140Â GiB of source code.</description>

      <title>Give my luck back, Firefox 5!</title>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded to firefox 5, special thanks to Debian developer for packaging it. So far, everything works well and better than before, except two things (one of which I managed to tweak):&#xA;The tabs bar is higher than before. This means that the mouse must move more to reach them. This has been solved. Thanks for allowing me to put the tabs bar below back again.&#xA;The address bar no more involves &amp;ldquo;I feel lucky&amp;rdquo; search.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been searching for a way to complete variables containing directories with the &amp;ldquo;cd&amp;rdquo; command in bash. This is very helpful if you have something like &amp;ldquo;cd $mydir/&amp;rdquo;. This is not actually working in debian bash-completion.&#xA;Then I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that other commands such as &amp;ldquo;ls&amp;rdquo; actually expand variables. I looked for some &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; combo used for &amp;ldquo;ls&amp;rdquo; but not for &amp;ldquo;cd&amp;rdquo; in /etc/bash_completion and I came out with the following:</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m lately doing some tests with Debian experimental packages thus I often upgrade some packages to experimental and downgrade them back to unstable.&#xA;WARNING: Downgrading in Debian is not supported etc.&#xA;aptitude search &amp;#34;?narrow(?installed,?archive(experimental))&amp;#34; -F %p|\\ sed &amp;#39;s,\\(\[^ \]\*\\),\\1/unstable,&amp;#39;|xargs echo This will give you a list of experimental packages installed on your system each concatenated with &amp;ldquo;/unstable&amp;rdquo;. The output can go straight to &amp;ldquo;aptitude install&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t directly use &amp;ldquo;xargs aptitude install&amp;rdquo; because it&amp;rsquo;s not interactive.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;lately I&amp;rsquo;ve received some feedback, thanks for this.&#xA;Is it compatible with apt? Can I use dpkg back again after using tdpkg?&#xA;The answer is&amp;hellip; yes! You can use what you want in the order you want, and use tdpkg when you want. Take in consideration that after using dpkg (or apt) without tdpkg, then you use tdpkg the cache will be rebuilt for consistency.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s not working here (Ubuntu, other distro&amp;hellip;), doesn&amp;rsquo;t create the cache.</description>

      <title>Tdpkg 1.0 - speed up reading dpkg database</title>
      <link>https://lucabrun.github.io/2010/03/tdpkg-speed-up-reading-dpkg-database.html</link>

      <guid>https://lucabrun.github.io/2010/03/tdpkg-speed-up-reading-dpkg-database.html</guid>
      <description>Hello,&#xA;you may have noticed that dpkg takes a long time reading the database the first time you run it (e.g. through apt). This is because of the huge number of /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list files (1700+ on my desktop machines). It can take up to 14 seconds and more at cold start to install/remove a single package.&#xA;Since 2007 in dpkg mailing list a first proposal (by Sean Finney) to using sqlite as cache has been posted, then a couple of weeks ago I reproposed it.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;due to some synchronization problems between my desktop and laptop, unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my GPG secret key. I was planning to renew my key after the SHA issues, but this way I can&amp;rsquo;t neither revoke the old key nor sign the new key. So I please anybody having my pubkey to delete it:&#xA;gpg &amp;ndash;delete-key C29A9371&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded my new key as usual so you can get it:&#xA;gpg &amp;ndash;keyserver pgp.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;due to the high resource usage by Eclipse (I have to use that unfortunately because of my professor) I&amp;rsquo;ve temporarly dropped GNOME and now I&amp;rsquo;m using Awesome for a while.&#xA;Ok let&amp;rsquo;s say the problem: the keyboard. Do you have different languages, layouts and so on among several configurations (GNOME, X, &amp;hellip;) and your keyboard layout is messed up with awesome?&#xA;Just do it:&#xA;setxkbmap -layout YOURLAYOUT&#xA;Where YOURLAYOUT for me is it.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a way to convert a mailman archive to an mbox format so that I could open with mutt.&#xA;I then found a couple of scripts, but the one I&amp;rsquo;ve found simpler and working for my needs is mailbox2mbox.pl.&#xA;Sample usage:&#xA;$ gunzip YourArchive.txt.gz $ perl mailbox2mbox.pl &amp;lt; YourArchive.txt &amp;gt; mbox $ mutt -f mbox And it simply works!&#xA;Does anybody know a method as simple as the above one but more powerful?</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I was curious to see if aptitude-gtk was making some progress. I haven&amp;rsquo;t followed the project since it&amp;rsquo;s been merged into aptitude.&#xA;Well, I found it more functional and complete. Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot showing pending packages for upgrade after an update:&#xA;From GNOME&#xA;The team is definitely doing a good job. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll find the time to give some help as I&amp;rsquo;m really interested in such full-featured GUI frontend.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on FreeSpeak a couple of years ago, a Python/GTK+/GNOME project to translate text and web pages by querying already existing online translation tools.&#xA;PRO: It has been packed for Ubuntu and it has been publicized by a journal in Italy.&#xA;CONS: It has been discontinued until now. In fact I restarted the project and I&amp;rsquo;m doing a huge refactoring because of the ugly code I wrote in the past.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s being developed by SuSE. It feels nice, robust and innovative.&#xA;The screenshot is showing the documents tab.&#xA;To install, aptitude install gnome-main-menu and add the new applet.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using qemu a lot lately because I&amp;rsquo;m creating an usb hdd with debian live.&#xA;The image contains a system running postgresql, development packages for gtk and python and gnome-core . All this ends up loading in more than 5 minutes, this is really boring.&#xA;Then I begun looking for a faster virtualization system, and found KVM. Unfortunately my processor hasn&amp;rsquo;t the right flag for it.&#xA;Finally I found kqemu, which is a module for the kernel that speeds up a lot qemu.</description>

Boot process slowed down by 30 seconds and couldn&amp;rsquo;t plug-in the usb pen because udev/hal screw up What I&amp;rsquo;ve done is to remove the source and its created firmware, with the one shipped with testing and unstable (bug #411912):</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;this is my second post about Debian. I&amp;rsquo;m lately discovering all the tools for both managing my Debian system and creating packages.&#xA;dh_make is the first tool I&amp;rsquo;ve used for the &amp;ldquo;first debianization&amp;rdquo; (called so by the New maintainers&amp;rsquo; guide) which creates a basic template for your package.&#xA;Anyway after a few packagings I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that something redundant could be automatized further.&#xA;What I suggest is a tool that does the following stuff after dh_make has been called:</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I switched to Debian lately and i think it will become my preferred distribution.&#xA;I started with Slackware, then an LFS and then Gentoo. I never found them definitive for me.&#xA;I used Slackware by compiling sources most of all, then i didn&amp;rsquo;t see any reason to continue using it.&#xA;The LFS came since my new PC as a test, and as long I could maintain it I had no problems and had fun with it.</description>
