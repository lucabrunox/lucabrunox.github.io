      <description>I present gtkhah, a gtk module for hit-a-hint mouseless navigation of gtk3 applications.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s been inspired by the various hit-a-hint browser extensions.&#xA;Usage at the project homepage. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick screenshot of Gedit:</description>

      <title>Grab focus on Gtk Widget</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2012/11/grab-focus-on-gtk-widget.html</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2012/11/grab-focus-on-gtk-widget.html</guid>
      <description>Many times I had to give focus to a newly created Gtk widget that still had to be mapped to screen. Since widget.grab_focus() does not work if the widget is not displayed on the screen, then I always used an idle source to delay the operation.&#xA;Today I noticed that the idle may be too late: if the user is writing something, then some key strokes may be lost because the idle runs slightly after the widget has been mapped.</description>

      <title>Using Mash with Vala</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2010/07/using-mash-with-vala.html</guid>
      <description>Hello,&#xA;recently Mash has been released. It is a library for reading models in PLY format and creating Clutter actors from them. For reference, Blender is able to export to PLY. It means you can draw your models with Blender and use Clutter as rendering engine.&#xA;Clutter is a 3D canvas and animation toolkit while Blender is a 3D modelling suite.&#xA;What I&amp;rsquo;ve tested so far is porting the Monkey Viewer C example to Vala: code snippet and monkey PLY here.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s often useful for Vala hackers to have a graphical representation of the code tree and control flow blocks. Therefore I&amp;rsquo;ve created a simple application called Valag which generates four types of diagrams using Graphviz for each state of the Vala compiler.&#xA;This is the first release, there&amp;rsquo;re many things to fix and enhance (like command line options) but it is working quite good already to give support when hacking Vala.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m lately following the Vala development and finally we got a new release with plenty of bug fixes and enhancements which makes Vala even more interesting and usable as general purpose language.&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s the announcement.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d like to point you to the new Vala journal, a good resource to stay tuned with Vala changes periodically.&#xA;News:&#xA;* Support coalescing operator ??.&#xA;* Support to_string and bitwise complement with enums.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;a while ago I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about pango cairo and how to generate pdf with a couple of tables.&#xA;In the meantime I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on it, improving and enhancing new kinds of elements. This has lead to the creation of a small project, a library providing a simple framework for generating mostly PDF reports (I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried to generate SVG or something else yet).&#xA;After a couple of release requests, I&amp;rsquo;ve found finally the time to publish a sort of working code.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;multimedia always killed desktop performance, also audio with all such effect-based players out there. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using deezer for a long time, but sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m tired to see my desktop lagging.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t need that, I need random music from internet while I&amp;rsquo;m either programming or studying, and my computer has only 512mb ram and 2.4ghz amd64 (onLY??? yes nowadays it&amp;rsquo;s a little amount).&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s see what we can do using gst-launch:</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2009/05/render-tables-with-pangocairo-like.html</guid>
      <description>Hello,&#xA;lately I was wondering if there was any alternative to the well known reportlab python software for creating PDF reports. I immediately thought about Cairo. The only two problems are:&#xA;Cairo doesn&amp;rsquo;t create multiple pages No support for creating tables containing text, necessary for table-based reports I still can&amp;rsquo;t realize how to achieve the first feature, but the second one could be solved using Pango layouts.&#xA;The idea is to create the cells of the table using such layouts, so that the text get wrapped etc.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Midori for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s a great browser: innovative and light. However all my bookmarks and data are in Epiphany. Last week the new epiphany-webkit version has been uploaded in Debian Sid and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to test it. I&amp;rsquo;m currently using it instead of gecko; it has still some issues but I begun living without it.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;sometimes in the code of a couple of projects I see some hard algorithms to transform a pixbuf in a cairo surface.&#xA;Maybe most of people don&amp;rsquo;t know that GdkCairoContext, contrarily to cairo_t, is created against a cairo context not a cairo surface:&#xA;`surface = cairo.ImageSurface (cairo.FORMAT_ARGB32, pixbuf.get_width(), pixbuf.get_height())&#xA;cr = cairo.Context (surface)&#xA;gdkcr = gtk.gdk.CairoContext (cr)&#xA;gdkcr.set_source_pixbuf (pixbuf)&#xA;gdkcr.paint ()`&#xA;Notice gtk.gdk.CairoContext (cr), which cr is not the surface.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;due to the high resource usage by Eclipse (I have to use that unfortunately because of my professor) I&amp;rsquo;ve temporarly dropped GNOME and now I&amp;rsquo;m using Awesome for a while.&#xA;Ok let&amp;rsquo;s say the problem: the keyboard. Do you have different languages, layouts and so on among several configurations (GNOME, X, &amp;hellip;) and your keyboard layout is messed up with awesome?&#xA;Just do it:&#xA;setxkbmap -layout YOURLAYOUT&#xA;Where YOURLAYOUT for me is it.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a way to create a desktop-wide keybinding for FreeSpeak.&#xA;I first looked into Tomboy and Deskbar source codes but the egg was too huge to be adopted, and it would have brought C dependency which isn&amp;rsquo;t always nice for a Python project.&#xA;Then fargiolas pointed me to a blog post where I could find about gnome keybindings owned by gnome control center. Well that was only a mirage as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really grab the key but it&amp;rsquo;s only a visual entry in the keyboard shortcuts preferences.</description>

I haven&amp;rsquo;t followed the project since it&amp;rsquo;s been merged into aptitude.&#xA;Well, I found it more functional and complete. Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot showing pending packages for upgrade after an update:&#xA;From GNOME&#xA;The team is definitely doing a good job. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll find the time to give some help as I&amp;rsquo;m really interested in such full-featured GUI frontend.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on FreeSpeak a couple of years ago, a Python/GTK+/GNOME project to translate text and web pages by querying already existing online translation tools.&#xA;PRO: It has been packed for Ubuntu and it has been publicized by a journal in Italy.&#xA;CONS: It has been discontinued until now. In fact I restarted the project and I&amp;rsquo;m doing a huge refactoring because of the ugly code I wrote in the past.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;you all know that Gtk+ has locks for the GUI when dealing with the X server and prevent async events to be sent. This is done by manually acquiring/releasing the lock on Gdk. Many Gtk+ ports don&amp;rsquo;t do this automatically.&#xA;Syx used gtk_main() into a thread and automatically put gdk enter/leave for each function in its wrapper. It would be somewhat ugly in Smalltalk code having to enter/leave each time.</description>
