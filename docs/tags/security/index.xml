      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d like to point you to this firefox extension HTTPS Everywhere (June 17th, 2010) and SSLGuard which is also a firefox extension (first released Oct 14th, 2009).&#xA;The code of the former extension is a lot more complicated and the result is not always quite the same as SSLGuard. In fact, while they support secure cookies and per-website custom rules, SSLGuard lets you add custom websites to be secured directly from a friendly graphical dialog.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m writing to let you know of the first release of SDChat.&#xA;It is a protocol with libraries and programs to create secure IM networks using GPG and RSA.&#xA;All the stack is written in Python but the page says it will be rewritten from scratch to provide a C API.&#xA;It features a GTK+ interface with many plugins (unfortunately audio and video are being broken due to gstreamer updates) and a simple server for routing.</description>
