      <description>_&#xA;Hello,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m officializing the change of web hosting and git hosting from googlecode to berlios:&#xA;_&#xA;The new website is up!&#xA;For several reasons, including reliability, we switched both the website and git hosting to berlios. Also the purpose of this change is to rewrite the website backend using Syx.&#xA;The mailing list and the bug tracker are still hosted at googlecode.&#xA;Some progress news in the while&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;re working on a new memory management, object representation and garbage collector.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;in the new branches of Syx (an open source Smalltalk-80 implementation) we&amp;rsquo;re working to try a new kind of memory management and add many features that have been missed until now to focus on other stuff.&#xA;The new faster and more modern v0.1.8 release will contain the following refactoring:&#xA;Objects will be variable-length (minumum 12 bytes on 32-bit processors and 16 bytes on 64-bit processors)&#xA;By changing the objects also the GC changed to a mark and compact GC</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;after several months a new version of Syx has been released. This release contains mostly VM changes and some changes to the Smalltalk Collections. As usual, release notes follow:&#xA;This versions enhances a new version of the interpreter, major updates to the scheduler, and as usual a lot of bug fixes. Syx left the Google Code SVN repositories because of many connection problems.&#xA;You can find informations about the new GIT repository here: http://code.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;you all know that Gtk+ has locks for the GUI when dealing with the X server and prevent async events to be sent. This is done by manually acquiring/releasing the lock on Gdk. Many Gtk+ ports don&amp;rsquo;t do this automatically.&#xA;Syx used gtk_main() into a thread and automatically put gdk enter/leave for each function in its wrapper. It would be somewhat ugly in Smalltalk code having to enter/leave each time.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;I report the post on the mailing list below:&#xA;Hello,&#xA;with the next release 0.1.7, once I get a working interpreter and updated all the parts of Syx,&#xA;I will move output of doxygen to doc/reference and start a texinfo manual in doc/manual.&#xA;My idea is to have this kind of manual:&#xA;What is Smalltalk Why Smalltalk YX Introduction to the language Introduction the Syx environment COMPLETE Class and methods documentation, EACH non private method will be documented with examples</description>

      <title>Smalltalk YX toward a new interpreter</title>

      <description>Hello,&#xA;Smalltalk YX is currently working on refactoring a part of the interpreter, relative to contexts and stack management.&#xA;The current version uses one stack per process but always create contexts for each method or block entered.&#xA;The new branch, called newinterp, won&amp;rsquo;t create those contexts anymore but they will be created only on-demand (e.g. thisContext). This means both less resources and garbage collector usage, and a possible speedup.&#xA;More informations on the mailing list here.</description>
