      <description>One side of the idea:&#xA;Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some comment systems that inline comments in the text itself, see an example here.&#xA;Other side of the idea:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented a couple of unsupervised algorithms for news text extraction from web pages in Javascript, and they work generally well. They&amp;rsquo;re also capable of splitting the news text into paragraphs and avoid image captions or other unrelated text.&#xA;The idea:&#xA;Merge the two ideas, as a new commenting service (like Disqus) for blogs, in a modern and interesting way.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately many of my snippets in this blog have been written and uploaded exclusively on refactory.org . It was a free service for uploading snippets of any kind, with a friendly versioning system and other cool features.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s now inactive since several months. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for anybody stumbling upon any post that has code hosted at refactory.org . From now on I will try to put the code in the post itself whenever I can, or find better places to upload the code.</description>
